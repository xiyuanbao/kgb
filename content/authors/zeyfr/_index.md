I am a 4th year undergrad majoring in electrical engineering. My main interests are sensors and satellites, but I'm easily swayed by other projects, especially those involving physics, space, sustainability, and video games. I like troubleshooting problems and building better things for the future. 

In KGB Lab, I am helping with the following:

- Assisting in setup for new lab, including identifying and ordering needed parts
- Designing modifications or replacements for lab equipment as needed
- Learning CAD, 3D printing, Labview, image processing for particle image velocimetry
