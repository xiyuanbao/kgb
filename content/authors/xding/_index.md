Xuesong Ding received her Ph.D. in Geophysics from The University of Sydney. She is currently a postdoctoral scholar working with Prof. Carolina Lithgow-Bertelloni in the Department of Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences in the University of California, Los Angeles since September 2019. 

Her research focuses on source-to-sink surface process modeling, landscape evolution in response to dynamic topogrpahy induced by mantle convection, and stratigraphic forward modeling.
