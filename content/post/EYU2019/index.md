# What is EYU?

[Exploring Your Universe (EYU)](https://www.physicalsciences.ucla.edu/eyu/) is one of UCLA’s biggest annual events, drawing in thousands of children, parents, and friends from the Los Angeles community to our campus on the first Sunday in November. Organized by [UCLA graduate students](https://www.exploringyouruniverse.org/about) and run by [volunteers](https://www.exploringyouruniverse.org/participant-info), this science fair has been a tradition to provide a day of free science education to all. For ten years, EYU has provided fun, hands-on experiments and presentations to curious minds and young future scientists alike. 

EYU 2019 was one of the main events in celebrating UCLA’s Centennial!
