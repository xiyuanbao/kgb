 abstract = {Seismic refraction studies of deep-crustal and upper mantle
structure beneath some oceanic hotspot provinces reveal the
presence of ultramafic bodies with P-wave velocities of Vp similar
to 7.4-8.0 km/s lying at or above the Moho, e. g., Hawaii, the
Marquesas, and La Reunion. However, at other hotspot provinces
such as the Galapagos, Nazca Ridge, and Louisville the lower crust
is intruded by large volumes of gabbroic (mafic) rocks (Vp similar
to 6.8-7.5 km/s). Ultramafic primary melts formed beneath mature
oceanic lithosphere at pressures of similar to 2-3 GPa (60-90 km
depth), and ponded at the Moho due to their relatively high
density, can explain the observed ultramafic deep-crustal bodies.
By contrast, plume melts formed at depths of similar to 15-30 km
beneath thin lithosphere crystallize assemblages that are more
gabbroic. The velocity and density gradient is particularly strong
in the pressure range 0.6-1.5 GPa due to the replacement of
plagioclase by olivine as melts become more MgO-rich with
increasing pressure (and degree) of melting. This anomalous
density gradient suggests a possible filtering effect whereby
plume melts equilibrated at relatively shallow depths beneath very
young and thin oceanic lithosphere may be expected to be of nearly
gabbroic (mafic) composition (similar to 6-10% MgO), whereas
ultramafic melts (MgO similar to 12-20%) formed beneath older,
thicker oceanic lithosphere must pond and undergo extensive
olivine and clinopyroxene fractionation before evolving residual
magmas of basaltic composition sufficiently buoyant to be erupted
at the surface. A survey of well-studied hotspot provinces of
highly-varying lithospheric age at the time of emplacement shows
that deep-crustal and upper mantle seismic refraction data are
consistent with this hypothesis. These results highlight the
importance of large-volume intrusive processes in the evolution of
hotspot magmas, with intrusive volumes being significantly larger
than those of the erupted lavas in most cases. Pyrolite melting
can account, to first order, for the total crustal column of
magmatic products, whereas alternative models such as selective
melting of pyroxenite blobs probably cannot.},
