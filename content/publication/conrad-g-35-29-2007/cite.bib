 abstract = {Concurrent changes in seawater chemistry, sea level, and
climate since the mid-Cretaceous are thought to result from an
ongoing decrease in the global rate of lithosphere production at
ridges. The present-day area distribution of seafloor ages,
however, is most easily explained if lithosphere production rates
were nearly constant during the past 180 m.y. We examined spatial
gradients of present-day seafloor ages and inferred ages for the
subducted Farallon plate to construct a history of spreading rates
in each major ocean basin since ca. 140 Ma, revealing dramatic
Cenozoic events. Globally, seafloor spreading rates increased by
similar to 20% during the early Cenozoic due to an increase in
plate speeds in the Pacific basin. Since then, subduction of the
fast-spreading Pacific-Farallon ridge system has led to a 12%
decrease in average global spreading rate and an 18% or more
decrease in the total rate of lithosphere production by the most
conservative estimates. These rapid changes during the Cenozoic
defy models of steady-state seafloor formation, and demonstrate
the time-dependent and evolving nature of plate tectonics on
Earth.},
