 abstract = {We predict the phase diagram of CaSiO3 perovskite, finding
the tetragonal I4/mcm structure transforming to cubic Pm (3) over
barm with increasing temperature. The transition temperature is
1150 K at 0 GPa, and 2450 K at 140 GPa. The c/a ratio of the
tetragonal structure is 1.018 at 100 GPa and increases on
compression, as does the static enthalpy difference between
tetragonal and cubic structures. The elastic constants of the
tetragonal phase at static conditions differ substantially from
those of the cubic phase with the Voigt-Reuss-Hill shear modulus
29% less at 100 GPa. Computations are based on density functional
theory in the local density and generalized gradient
approximations. The phase diagram and high temperature elastic
constants are computed using a mean field theory with parameters
of the Landau potential determined via structurally constrained
density functional theory calculations. We present a simple scheme
for systematically searching for the ground state over all
perovskite structures derivable from octahedral rotations within
the context of symmetry-preserving relaxation, which confirms
tetragonal I4/mcm as the ground state in density functional
theory. We argue that the experimental x-ray diffraction pattern
can be explained by the I4/mcm phase by considering the
development of preferred orientation under uniaxial compression.},
