 abstract = {Although the African Plate's northeastward absolute motion
slowed abruptly 30 million years ago, the South Atlantic's
spreading velocity has remained roughly constant over the past 80
million years, thus requiring a simultaneous westward acceleration
of the South American Plate, This plate velocity correlation
occurs because the two plates are coupled to general mantle
circulation. The deceleration of the African Plate, due to its
collision with the Eurasian Plate, diverts mantle flow westward,
increasing the net basal driving torque and westward velocity of
the South American Plate. One result of South America's higher
plate velocity is the increased cordilleran activity along its
western edge, beginning at about 30 million years ago.},
