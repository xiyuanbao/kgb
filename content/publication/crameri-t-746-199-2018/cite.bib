 abstract = {The sinking remnant of a surface plate crosses and
interacts with multiple boundaries in Earth's interior. Here, we
specifically investigate the prominent dynamic interaction of the
sinking plate portion with the upper-mantle transition zone and
its corresponding surface elevation signal. We unravel, for the
first time, that the collision of the sinking slab with the
transition zone induces a sudden, dramatic downward tilt of the a
upper plate towards the subduction trench. Unraveling this crucial
interaction was only possible thanks to state-of-the-art numerical
modelling and post-processing. The new model that is introduced
here to study the dynamically self-consistent temporal evolution
of subduction features accurate subduction-zone topography, robust
single-sided plate sinking, stronger plates close to laboratory
values, an upper-mantle phase transition, and simple continents at
a free surface. To distinguish the impact of the new physical
model features, three different setups are used: the simplest
model setup includes a basic high-viscosity lower mantle, the
second adds a 660-km phase transition, and the third includes,
additionally, a continental upper plate. Common to all models is
the clear topographic signal upon slab-transition-zone
interaction: the upper plate tilts abruptly towards the subduction
trench by about 0.05 degrees and over around 10 Ma. This dramatic
increase in upper-plate tilt can be related to the slab-induced
excitation of the high-viscosity lower mantle, which introduces a
wider flow pattern. A large change in horizontal extent of
inundation of up to 900 km is observed as a direct consequence of
the upper-plate tilting. Such an abrupt variation in surface
topography and inundation extent should be clearly visible in
temporal records of large-scale surface elevation and might
explain continental tilting as observed in Australia since the
Eocene and North America during the Phanerozoic.},
