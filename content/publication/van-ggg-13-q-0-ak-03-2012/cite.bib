 abstract = {Earth's subducting plates move 3-4 times faster than its
overriding plates, but it remains unclear whether these
contrasting plate speeds are caused by additional pull from
subducting slabs or by increased viscous drag on the
lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary beneath deeply-protruding
continental roots. To investigate the relative importance of
plausible controls, we predicted global patterns of plate motions
using numerical models that incorporate the influence of
subducting slabs, convective mantle flow, and continental roots.
From the mantle convection models, we computed a set of
dynamically consistent plate velocities by balancing forces that
drive and resist the motion of each plate. When deep continental
roots anchor to the sub-asthenospheric upper mantle, the
calculated patterns of plate motions are close to the observations
if only similar to 20% of (excess) upper mantle slab weight
contributes to the slab pull force. However, this small
contribution causes plates to move too slowly on average unless
mantle viscosity is a factor of similar to 2 lower than expected
from post-glacial rebound. In contrast, we show that predicted and
observed plate motions are more easily reconciled if even the
deepest continental roots are underlain by a low-viscosity layer
and at least half of (excess) upper mantle slab weight contributes
to the slab pull force. This preferred scenario agrees with recent
seismological evidence for a global asthenosphere and previously
proposed mechanisms for partial decoupling of slabs from surface
plates.},
