 abstract = {Although mantle slabs ultimately drive plate motions, the
mechanism by which they do so remains unclear. A detached slab
descending through the mantle will excite mantle flow that exerts
shear tractions on the base of the surface plates. This "slab
suction'' force drives subducting and overriding plates
symmetrically toward subduction zones. Alternatively, cold, strong
slabs may effectively transmit stresses to subducting surface
plates, exerting a direct "slab pull'' force on these plates,
drawing them rapidly toward subduction zones. This motion induces
mantle flow that pushes overriding plates away from subduction
zones. We constrain the relative importance of slab suction and
slab pull by comparing Cenozoic plate motions to model predictions
that include viscous mantle flow and a proxy for slab strength. We
find that slab pull from upper mantle slabs combined with slab
suction from lower mantle slabs explains the observation that
subducting plates currently move similar to4 times faster than
nonsubducting plates. This implies that upper mantle slabs are
strong enough to support their own weight. Slab suction and slab
pull presently account for about 40 and 60% of the forces on
plates, but slab suction only similar to30% if a low-viscosity
asthenosphere decouples plates from mantle flow. The importance
slab pull has been increasing steadily through the Cenozoic
because the mass and length of upper mantle slabs has been
increasing. This causes subducting plates to double their speed
relative to nonsubducting plates during this time period. Our
model explains this temporal evolution of plate motions for the
first time.},
