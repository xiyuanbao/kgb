 abstract = {Subduction exerts a strong control on surface topography
and is the main cause of large vertical motions in continents,
including past events of large-scale marine flooding and tilting.
The mechanism is dynamic deflection: the sinking of dense
subducted lithosphere gives rise to stresses that directly pull
down the surface. Here we show that subduction does not always
lead to downward deflections of the Earth's surface. Subduction of
young lithosphere at shallow angles (flat subduction) leaves it
neutrally or even positively buoyant with respect to underlying
mantle because the lithosphere is relatively warm compared with
older lithosphere, and because the thickened and hence drier
oceanic crust does not undergo the transformation of basalt to
denser eclogite. Accounting for neutrally buoyant flat segments
along with large variations in slab morphology in the South
American subduction zone explains along-strike and temporal
changes in dynamic topography observed in the geologic record
since the beginning of the Cenozoic. Our results show that the
transition from normal subduction to slab flattening generates
dynamic uplift, preventing back-arc marine flooding. (C) 2015
