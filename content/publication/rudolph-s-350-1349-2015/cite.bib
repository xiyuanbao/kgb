 abstract = {The viscosity structure of Earth's deep mantle affects the
thermal evolution of Earth, the ascent of mantle plumes, settling
of subducted oceanic lithosphere, and the mixing of compositional
heterogeneities in the mantle. Based on a reanalysis of the
long-wavelength nonhydrostatic geoid, we infer viscous layering of
the mantle using a method that allows us to avoid a priori
assumptions about its variation with depth. We detect an increase
in viscosity at 800- to 1200-kilometers depth, far greater than
the depth of the mineral phase transformations that define the
mantle transition zone. The viscosity increase is coincident in
depth with regions where seismic tomography has imaged slab
stagnation, plume deflection, and changes in large-scale structure
and offers a simple explanation of these phenomena.},
