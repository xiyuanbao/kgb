 abstract = {A fundamental question regarding the dynamics of mantle
convection is whether some intraplate volcanic centers, known as
"hotspots," are the surface manifestations of hot, narrow,
thermally driven upwellings, or plumes, rising from the lower
mantle. Shown here is a global negative correlation between the
thickness of the mantle transition zone (near 410-660 km depth)
and petrologically determined potential temperatures of mid-ocean
ridge and hotspot magmas. Hotspot potential temperatures are
systematically higher than those for mid-ocean ridges, and the
transition zone thicknesses beneath these hotspots are thinner.
Thus, the majority of oceanic intraplate magmatic centers are
associated with deep-seated thermal anomalies, suggesting that
such magmatism is probably associated with thermal plumes. (c)
