 abstract = {Discovering the connection between processes observed to
occur at the surface of the Earth and its internal dynamics
remains an essential goal in the Earth sciences. Deep mantle
structure, as inferred from seismic tomography or subduction
history, has been shown to account well for the observed surface
gravity field and motions of tectonic plates(1-3). But the origin
of certain large-scale features, such as the anomalous elevation
of the southern and eastern African plateaux, has remained
controversial. Whereas the average elevation of most cratons is
between 400 and 500 m, the southern African plateau stands more
than 1 km above sea level, with the surrounding oceans possessing
a residual bathymetry in excess of 500 m (ref. 4). Global seismic
tomography studies have persistently indicated the existence of a
large-scale low-velocity anomaly beneath the African plate(5-10)
and here we show that mantle flow induced by the density
variations inferred from these velocity anomalies can dynamically
support the excess elevation of the African 'superswell'. We also
find that this upwelling mantle flow-which is most intense near
the core-mantle boundary-constitutes a significant driving force
for tectonic plates in the region.},
