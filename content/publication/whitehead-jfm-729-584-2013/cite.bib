 abstract = {Convection from an isolated heat source in a chamber has
been previously studied numerically, experimentally and
analytically. These have not covered long time spans for wide
ranges of Rayleigh number Ra and Prandtl number Pr. Numerical
calculations of constant viscosity convection partially fill the
gap in the ranges Ra = 10(3)-10(6) and Pr = 1, 10, 100, 1000 and
infinity. Calculations begin with cold fluid everywhere and
localized hot temperature at the centre of the bottom of a square
two-dimensional chamber. For Ra > 20 000, temperature increases
above the hot bottom and forms a rising plume head. The head has
small internal recirculation and minor outward conduction of heat
during ascent. The head approaches the top, flattens, splits and
the two remnants are swept to the sidewalls and diffused away. The
maximum velocity and the top centre heat flux climb to maxima
during head ascent and then adjust toward constant values. Two
steady cells are separated by a vertical thermal conduit. This
sequence is followed for every value of Pr number, although lower
Pr convection lags in time. For Ra < 20 000 there is no plume
head, and no streamfunction and heat flux maxima with time. For
sufficiently large Ra and all values of Pr, an oscillation
develops at roughly t = 0.2, with the two cells alternately
strengthening and weakening. This changes to a steady flow with
two unequal cells that at roughly t = 0.5 develops a second
oscillation.},
