 abstract = {Supracrustal tectonics and mantle flow interact to create
Earth's topography. While tectonics is associated with the
isostatic components of topography, the deflections caused by
mantle dynamics, or dynamic topography, represent the
non-isostatic components. South America is an ideal natural
laboratory to analyze these two contrasting components from the
high Andes to the distal plains. Both regions are active and
affected by complex geodynamic processes like the subduction of
oceanic ridges, geometry and age of slabs, etc. These subducting
anomalies affect not only the convergence dynamics and stresses
along the entire margin, but also the distribution of mass
anomalies in the mantle, which are the main cause of
sublithospheric flow and dynamic topography. Here we revisited
five examples from north to south, which demonstrate that, the
Andes and the distal forelands have been uncompensated since the
beginning of the Cenozoic and that additional forces, such as
mantle downwellings and upwellings, are required to account for
the observed topographies in basins and elevations. (C) 2013
