 abstract = {The discovery of almost two thousand exoplanets has
revealed an unexpectedly diverse planet population. We see gas
giants in few-day orbits, whole multi-planet systems within the
orbit of Mercury, and new populations of planets with masses
between that of the Earth and Neptune-all unknown in the Solar
System. Observations to date have shown that our Solar System is
certainly not representative of the general population of planets
in our Milky Way. The key science questions that urgently need
addressing are therefore: What are exoplanets made of? Why are
planets as they are? How do planetary systems work and what causes
the exceptional diversity observed as compared to the Solar
System? The EChO (Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory) space
mission was conceived to take up the challenge to explain this
diversity in terms of formation, evolution, internal structure and
planet and atmospheric composition. This requires in-depth
spectroscopic knowledge of the atmospheres of a large and
well-defined planet sample for which precise physical, chemical
and dynamical information can be obtained. In order to fulfil this
ambitious scientific program, EChO was designed as a dedicated
survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable of
observing a large, diverse and well-defined planet sample within
its 4-year mission lifetime. The transit and eclipse spectroscopy
method, whereby the signal from the star and planet are
differentiated using knowledge of the planetary ephemerides,
allows us to measure atmospheric signals from the planet at levels
of at least 10(-4) relative to the star. This can only be achieved
in conjunction with a carefully designed stable payload and
satellite platform. It is also necessary to provide broad
instantaneous wavelength coverage to detect as many molecular
species as possible, to probe the thermal structure of the
planetary atmospheres and to correct for the contaminating effects
of the stellar photosphere. This requires wavelength coverage of
at least 0.55 to 11 mu m with a goal of covering from 0.4 to 16 mu
m. Only modest spectral resolving power is needed, with R similar
to 300 for wavelengths less than 5 mu m and R similar to 30 for
wavelengths greater than this. The transit spectroscopy technique
means that no spatial resolution is required. A telescope
collecting area of about 1 m(2) is sufficiently large to achieve
the necessary spectro-photometric precision: for the Phase A study
a 1.13 m(2) telescope, diffraction limited at 3 mu m has been
adopted. Placing the satellite at L2 provides a cold and stable
thermal environment as well as a large field of regard to allow
efficient time-critical observation of targets randomly
distributed over the sky. EChO has been conceived to achieve a
single goal: exoplanet spectroscopy. The spectral coverage and
signal-to-noise to be achieved by EChO, thanks to its high
stability and dedicated design, would be a game changer by
allowing atmospheric composition to be measured with unparalleled
exactness: at least a factor 10 more precise and a factor 10 to
1000 more accurate than current observations. This would enable
the detection of molecular abundances three orders of magnitude
lower than currently possible and a fourfold increase from the
handful of molecules detected to date. Combining these data with
estimates of planetary bulk compositions from accurate
measurements of their radii and masses would allow degeneracies
associated with planetary interior modelling to be broken, giving
unique insight into the interior structure and elemental
abundances of these alien worlds. EChO would allow scientists to
study exoplanets both as a population and as individuals. The
mission can target super-Earths, Neptune-like, and Jupiter-like
planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperatures
of 300-3000 K) of F to M-type host stars. The EChO core science
would be delivered by a three-tier survey. The EChO Chemical
Census: This is a broad survey of a few-hundred exoplanets, which
allows us to explore the spectroscopic and chemical diversity of
the exoplanet population as a whole. The EChO Origin: This is a
deep survey of a subsample of tens of exoplanets for which
significantly higher signal to noise and spectral resolution
spectra can be obtained to explain the origin of the exoplanet
diversity (such as formation mechanisms, chemical processes,
atmospheric escape). The EChO Rosetta Stones: This is an
ultra-high accuracy survey targeting a subsample of select
exoplanets. These will be the bright "benchmark" cases for which a
large number of measurements would be taken to explore temporal
variations, and to obtain two and three dimensional spatial
information on the atmospheric conditions through eclipse-mapping
techniques. If EChO were launched today, the exoplanets currently
observed are sufficient to provide a large and diverse sample. The
Chemical Census survey would consist of > 160 exoplanets with a
range of planetary sizes, temperatures, orbital parameters and
stellar host properties. Additionally, over the next 10 years,
several new ground- and space-based transit photometric surveys
and missions will come on-line (e.g. NGTS, CHEOPS, TESS, PLATO),
which will specifically focus on finding bright, nearby systems.
The current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list to
be further optimised in the years prior to EChO's launch and
enable the atmospheric characterisation of hundreds of planets.},
