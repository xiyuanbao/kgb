 abstract = {We use a self-consistent thermodynamic formalism to compute
the phase equilibria and physical properties of model mantle
compositions, demonstrating that the seismological properties of a
mantle comprised of (1) an equilibrium assemblage (EA) of
pyrolitic composition and (2) a mechanical mixture (MM) of basalt
and harzburgite with identical bulk composition differ
significantly. We calculate the density, compressional wave
velocity (V,,), and shear wave velocity (Vs) of EA and MM with
basalt fraction varying from 0% to 100% and along adiabats with
potential temperatures ranging from 1000 K to 2000 K. For MM, Vs
in the transition zone is greater, increases more rapidly with
depth, and is insensitive to basalt fraction, while for EA Vs
decreases by 2.5% with increasing basalt fraction for fractions <
70%. The magnitude and sharpness of the 520-km discontinuity
depends strongly on temperature in both EA and MM, which may
explain lateral variations in its seismic detection. Both MM and
EA feature complex structure in the depth range 640750 km due to
the transformations of akimotoite, ringwoodite, and garnet to
denser assemblages. MM is faster than most seismological models in
the upper mantle, and slower in the lower mantle, suggesting an
increase of basalt fraction with depth in the mantle. (c) 2008
