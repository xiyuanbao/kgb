 abstract = {Convection in the Earth's mantle is mainly driven by cold,
dense subducting slabs, but relatively little is known about how
3D variations in slab morphology and buoyancy affect mantle flow
or how the surface above deforms in response (i.e. dynamic
topography). We investigate this problem by studying the dynamics
of an active region of flat-slab subduction located in Peru in
South America. Here the slab geometry is well known, based on the
regional seismicity, and we have observations from the local
geological record to validate our models. Of particular interest
is the widespread subsidence and deposition of the Solimoes
Formation across western Amazonia that coincided with the
development of the Peruvian flat-slab during the Mid-Late Miocene.
This formation covers an extensive area from the foredeep to the
Purus Arch located similar to 2000 km away from the trench. Close
to the Andes the preservation of several kilometers of sedimentary
thicknesses can be easily accounted for by flexure. Based on an
estimate of the Andean loading we predict 2.8 to 3.6 km of
accommodation space that spans 100 km. The spatial and temporal
history of the Solimoes Formation however, particularly the thick
distal foreland accumulations up to 1.2 km deep, can only be
matched with the addition of a longer-wavelength dynamic source of
topography. Following the transition from normal to flat
subduction, we predict over 1 km of dynamic subsidence (similar to
1500 km wide) that propagates over 1000 km away from the trench,
tracking the subduction leading edge. This is followed by a pulse
of dynamic uplift over the flat segment behind it. We therefore
propose that a combination of uplift, flexure and dynamic
topography during slab flattening in Peru is responsible for the
sedimentation history and landscape evolution of western Amazonia
that eventually led to the configuration of the Amazon Drainage
Basin we know today. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
