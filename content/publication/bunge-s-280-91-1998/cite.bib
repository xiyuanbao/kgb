 abstract = {Computer models of mantle convection constrained by the
history of Cenozoic and Mesozoic plate motions explain some
deep-mantle structural heterogeneity imaged by seismic tomography,
especially those related to subduction. They also reveal a
150-million-year time scale for generating thermal heterogeneity
in the mantle, comparable to the record of plate motion
reconstructions, so that the problem of unknown initial conditions
can be overcome. The pattern of lowermost mantle structure at the
core-mantle boundary is controlled by subduction history, although
seismic tomography reveals intense large-scale hot (low-velocity)
upwelling features not explicitly predicted by the models.},
