 abstract = {The thermal evolution of Earth is governed by the rate of
secular cooling and the amount of radiogenic heating. If mantle
heat sources are known, surface heat flow at different times may
be used to deduce the efficiency of convective cooling and
ultimately the temporal character of plate tectonics. We estimate
global heat flow from 65 Ma to the present using seafloor age
reconstructions and a modified half-space cooling model, and we
find that heat flow has decreased by similar to 0.15% every
million years during the Cenozoic. By examining geometric trends
in plate reconstructions since 120 Ma, we show that the reduction
in heat flow is due to a decrease in the area of ridge-proximal
oceanic crust. Even accounting for uncertainties in plate
reconstructions, the rate of heat flow decrease is an order of
magnitude faster than estimates based on smooth, parameterized
cooling models. This implies that heat flow experiences short-term
fluctuations associated with plate tectonic cyclicity. Continental
separation does not appear to directly control convective
wavelengths, but rather indirectly affects how oceanic plate
systems adjust to accommodate global heat transport. Given that
today's heat flow may be unusually low, secular cooling rates
estimated from present-day values will tend to underestimate the
average cooling rate. Thus, a mechanism that causes less efficient
tectonic heat transport at higher temperatures may be required to
prevent an unreasonably hot mantle in the recent past.},
