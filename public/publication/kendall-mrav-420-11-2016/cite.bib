 abstract = {Continental rifting has a fundamental role in the tectonic
behaviour of the Earth, shaping the surface we live on. Although
there is not yet a consensus about the dominant mechanism for
rifting, there is a general agreement that the stresses required
to rift the continental lithosphere are not readily available.
Here we use a global finite element model of the lithosphere to
calculate the stresses acting on Africa. We consider the stresses
induced by mantle flow, crustal structure and topography in two
types of models: one in which flow is exclusively driven by the
subducting slabs and one in which it is derived from a shear wave
tomographic model. The latter predicts much larger stresses and a
more realistic dynamic topography. It is therefore clear that the
mantle structure beneath Africa plays a key part in providing the
radial and horizontal tractions, dynamic topography and
gravitational potential energy necessary for rifting.
Nevertheless, the total available stress (c. 100 MPa) is much less
than that needed to break thick, cold continental lithosphere.
Instead, we appeal to a model of magma-assisted rifting along
pre-existing weaknesses, where the strain is localized in a narrow
axial region and the strength of the plate is reduced
significantly. Mounting geological and geophysical observations
support such a model.},
