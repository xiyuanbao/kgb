 abstract = {[1] An understanding of the tectonic stress field is
geologically important because it is the agent that preserves in
the crust a memory of dynamical processes. In an effort to
elucidate the origin of the present state of stress of the
lithosphere we use a finite element model of the Earth's
lithosphere to calculate stresses induced by mantle flow, crustal
heterogeneity, and topography and compare these to observations of
intraplate stresses as given by the World Stress Map. We explore
two models of lithospheric heterogeneity, one based directly on
seismic and other observational constraints ( Crust 2.0), and
another that assumes isostatic compensation. Mantle tractions are
computed from two models of mantle density heterogeneity: a model
based on the history of subduction of the last 180 Myr, which has
proved successful at accurately reproducing the present-day geoid
and Cenozoic plate velocities, and a model inferred from seismic
tomography. We explore the effects of varying assumptions for the
viscosity structure of the mantle, and the effects of lateral
variations in viscosity in the form of weak plate boundaries. We
find that a combined model that includes both mantle and
lithospheric sources of stress yields the best match to the
observed stress field ( similar to 60% variance reduction),
although there are many regions where agreement between observed
and predicted stresses is poor. The stress field produced by
mantle tractions alone shows a greater degree of long-wavelength
structure than is apparent in the stress observations but agrees
very well with observations in some areas where radial mantle
tractions are particularly strong such as in southeast Asia and
the western Pacific. The stress field produced by lithospheric
heterogeneity alone depends strongly on the assumed crustal model:
Whereas the isostatically compensated model yields very poor
agreement with observations, the model based on Crust 2.0 matches
the observations about as well as mantle tractions alone and
matches very well in certain areas where the influence of high
topography is very important ( e. g., Andes, East Africa). A
possible interpretation of our results is that the stress field is
significantly influenced by lateral variations in the viscosity of
the mantle, which leads to variable amounts of decoupling between
lithosphere and mantle, allowing the mantle signature to dominate
in some areas and the crustal signature to dominate in others. The
poor fit between the isostatically compensated crustal model and
observations and the large differences between the two crustal
models point toward the importance of dynamic topography and
remaining uncertainties in crustal structure and rheology. We also
consider the possibility that observations of stress from the
shallow crust may not reflect the state of stress of the entire
plate; stresses in the upper plate may be at least partially
decoupled from broader- scale plate driving forces by lateral and
vertical variations in lithospheric rheology.},
