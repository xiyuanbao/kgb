 abstract = {Lithospheric density and thickness variations are important
contributors to the state of stress of the plates. The
relationship between the lithosphere's isostatic state, subcrustal
structure and stress field, however, remains unresolved due to the
uncertainties on its thickness, composition and rheology. To study
the influence of lithospheric structure on intraplate stresses, we
use a new model of global lithospheric structure (TDL) that
accounts for the presence of depleted mantle to explore the
effects of isostatic compensation, mantle density structure,
lithospheric thickness (base depth) and mechanical coupling within
the lithosphere on wavelengths >200 km. We compute the mean
lithostatic stress (O) of 2 degrees x 2 degrees lithospheric
columns and then solve for the resulting global tectonic stress
field for a homogeneous elastic lithosphere with the finite
element package ABAQUS. For a 100 km base depth, a historically
common value for lithospheric thickness, tectonic stress patterns
are largely insensitive to mantle density structure and match
patterns in the world stress map, for both isostatically
compensanted and non-compensated lithospheric structure.
Increasing the base depth up to 250 km to account for thick
continental roots, however, leads to sharp variations in the
stress field between isostatic lithospheric structure models and
TDL as the mantle portion of the lithosphere dominates O.
Decreasing the model base depths up to 25 km as a proxy for
vertical strength variations due to low viscosity channels within
the crust or lithosphere as a whole, strongly alters stresses in
magnitude, azimuth and regime, as the influence of topography and
shallow crustal structure increases. We find that restricting
spatial changes in O to a specified region to mimic lateral
variations in strength also has a large effect on the resulting
stresses, which leads us to conclude that regional models may not
always be adequate for modelling the stress field. Strong
deviations from long-wavelength patterns on the world stress map
in models with a shallow (<<100 km) or deep (>>150 km)
uncompensated model base depth likely reflect that the globally
averaged lithospheric thickness is close to 100 km and large
deviations from this depth generate unrealistic stress patterns
related to uncompensated buoyancy forces. Because the stresses are
so sensitive to base depth, we conclude that using O to represent
spatial and vertical variations in lithospheric structure is not
an adequate approximation. Our results suggest that future studies
must incorporate the full 3-D variations in density and rheology
of the lithosphere to elucidate the source and nature of the
lithospheric stress field. These studies have become possible with
the advent of modern computational tools and advances in our
knowledge of lithospheric structure and rheology.},
