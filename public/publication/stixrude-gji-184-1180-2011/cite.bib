 abstract = {P>We complete the development and description of a
thermodynamic method for the computation of phase equilibria and
physical properties of multiphase mantle assemblages. Our previous
paper focused on the computation of physical properties. In this
paper, our focus shifts to the phase equilibria. We further
develop our theory to specify the ideal and excess contributions
to solution properties and derive properties of multiphase
assemblages. We discuss our global inversion strategy for
determining the values of the free parameters in our theory and
compare inverted parameter values with expectations based on
scaling arguments. Comparisons between our method and experimental
phase equilibria data encompass the pressure-temperature regime of
Earth's mantle. Finally, we present applications of our method
that illustrate how it may be used to explore the origins of
mantle structure and mantle dynamics. Continuing rapid advances in
experimental and theoretical petrology and mineral physics have
motivated an expansion of the scope of our model via the addition
of several new phases, and of the soda component: an appendix
lists all parameters in our model and references to the
experimental and theoretical studies that constrain them. Our
algorithm for global minimization of the Gibbs free energy is
embodied in a code called HeFESTo, and is detailed in a second
appendix.},
