 abstract = {Mantle convection can drive long-wavelength and
low-amplitude topography, which can occur synchronously and
superimposed to tectonics. The discrimination between these two
topographic components, however, is difficult to assert. This is
because there are still several uncertainties and debates in the
geodynamic community, for example, the scales and rates of dynamic
topography. Geological, geomorphological, geophysical
measurements, and/or landscape analyses might assist to validate
models. In this contribution, we provide new geological evidences
along the Central and Patagonian Andes, which demonstrate that
dynamic topography has been an important component on the South
American landscape formation as well as in the ancient western
Gondwana. Our examples in the Argentine Pampas show that dynamic
topography is required to explain not only the basin subsidence
but also the whole observed topography. We also suggest that the
dynamic components in this region are much lower than numerical
models (average dynamic subsidence rates of similar to 0.04
mm/yr-this work-which contrast with the similar to 0.1 mm/yr
estimated in the US). We also propose two strategies to analyze
ancient cases. The first requires of comparing a total elevation
proxy, like the equilibrium lines (or ELA) in glaciated areas,
with model topography derived from geochemical studies of mantle
rocks. A second strategy was the analysis of the Triassic rifting
evolution of western Argentina (post-rift sag deposits). Sag
deposit thicknesses exceed 2 km, which do not correlate with the
100 m thick thermal calculated by rift subsidence modeling.},
