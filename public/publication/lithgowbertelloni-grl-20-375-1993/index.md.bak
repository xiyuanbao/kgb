abstract: "Changes in plate motions and plate configurations during the Cenozoic and Mesozoic have been investigated extensively, but most geodynamical models have concentrated on present-day plate motions. We have investigated the recent evolution of plate tectonics by examining the history of toroidal-poloidal partitioning of plate motions. Taking into account estimated errors, our results suggest a significant increase in the ratio of toroidal to poloidal motions postdating the Hawaiian-Emperor (H-E) bend at 43 Ma, corresponding to an overall decrease in global plate motions. These changes may reflect greater mantle plume activity in the Mesozoic, but a causal mechanism is not obvious. In general, observed Cenozoic and Mesozoic plate motions do not appear to be random, which implies that they are correlated. We also find perhaps three significant changes in net rotation of the lithosphere with respect to hotspots since 120 Ma."
