 abstract = {Subduction zone seismicity is highly variable. Great
earthquakes occur at few subduction zones around the world, with
significant variation in size and frequency of deep events.
Interactions between overriding and subducting plates and slab
pull strength for individual plates provide a framework for
understanding these variations. Previous work suggests an inverse
correlation between great earthquake moment release and the degree
to which the subducted slab is connected to the surface plate. We
find positive correlations between degree of plate- slab
attachment and moment release from intermediate and deep
earthquakes. This implies that shallow slab weakening that occurs
at trenches where compressive stresses ( and great earthquakes)
dominate not only detaches slabs from plates, but is maintained as
the slab descends, discouraging deep seismicity. Regions of low
shallow moment release are consistent with extensional shallow
stress regimes and undamaged slabs. Such slabs maintain mechanical
strength during descent and deform seismogenically at depth.},
