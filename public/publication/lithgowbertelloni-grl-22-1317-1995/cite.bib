 abstract = {Past studies of plate driving forces have concluded that
the forces due to subducted slabs in the upper mantle and those
due to the thickening of the oceanic lithosphere are the principal
driving forces. We reexamine the balance of driving forces for the
present-day and extend our analysis through the Cenozoic, using an
analytical torque balance method which accounts for interactions
between plates via viscous coupling to the induced mantle flow, We
use an evolving mantle density heterogeneity field based on the
last 200 Myr. of subduction to drive plate motions, an approach
which has proven successful in predicting the present-day mantle
heterogeneity field. We find that for plausible upper mantle
viscosities the forces due to subducted slabs in the Cenozoic and
Mesozoic account for in excess of 90% of plate driving forces and
those due to lithospheric thickening for less than 10%.},
