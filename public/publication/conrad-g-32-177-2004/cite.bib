 abstract = {Upwelling or downwelling flow in Earth's mantle is thought
to elevate or depress Earth's surface on a continental scale.
Direct observation of this "dynamic topography" on the seafloor,
however, has remained elusive because it is obscured by
isostatically supported topography caused by near-surface density
variations. We calculate the nonisostatic topography of the North
Atlantic by correcting seafloor depths for lithospheric cooling
and sediment loading, and find that seafloor west of the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge is an average of 0.5 km deeper than it is to
the east. We are able to reproduce this basic observation in a
model of mantle flow driven by tomographically inferred mantle
densities. This model shows that the Farallon slab, currently in
the lower mantle beneath the east coast of North America, induces
downwelling flow that deepens the western North Atlantic relative
to the east. Our model also predicts dynamic support of observed
topographic highs near Iceland and the Azores, but suggests that
the Icelandic high is due to local upper-mantle upwelling, while
the Azores high is part of a plate-scale lower-mantle upwelling to
the south. An anomalously deep area off the coast of Nova Scotia
may be associated with the downwelling component of edge-driven
convection at the continental boundary. Thus, several of the
seafloor's topographic features can only be understood in terms of
dynamic support from flow in Earth's mantle.},
