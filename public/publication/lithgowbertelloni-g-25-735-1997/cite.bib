 abstract = {Time-varying global dynamic topography has been computed
for the entire Cenozoic, The spherical viscous-flow model is
driven by a distribution of density heterogeneity based on
Mesozoic and Cenozoic subduction. By using the calculated
topography, the uplift and subsidence histories of five regions
fixed to the North American, Indian, Australian, Indonesian, and
South American continents are computed. Predicted vertical motions
are in qualitative agreement with observed values except for India
and South America. For Australia and North America, the predicted
periods of uplift and subsidence are out of phase with respect to
observations, but display the correct overall trend. The latest
phase of uplift for North America is directly related to the
cessation of Kula plate subduction after 48 Ma. Dynamic topography
depends on the viscosity structure of the mantle; a lower mantle
that is 50 times more viscous than the upper mantle yields the
best agreement between modeled and predicted vertical motions. The
presence of a low-viscosity channel beneath the lithosphere has
only a small influence on our results. Compared to dynamic
topography, the time-varying geoid is insignificant in controlling
relative sea level.},
