Our research focuses on the connection between Earth’s surface processes and the forces below the surface that drive and shape them. Recently, we reexamined how strong the Earth’s mantle is, and ventured into the connection between thermodynamics and fluid dynamics for our planet. The latter is particularly fascinating as it suggests that the thermodynamics of mantle materials exert a deep control on the thermal and perhaps biological evolution of our planet. We have also developed and applied joint techniques on particle image velocimetry and thermometry to the visualization and understanding of flow in very viscous fluids.\nThe Principal Investigator, Prof.Lithgow-Bertelloni, Carolina, is the Louis B. and Martha B.

She then moved on to a post-doc at Institut für Geophysik, Universität Göttingen, as an NSF postdoctoral fellow, and faculty positions at University of Michigan and University College London.

Their visit to UCLA was the first leg of a longer trip focusing on field excursions throughout the American southwest.\nMy goal for their visit was to provide the students with a flavor of the cutting-edge science that is carried out in the department, and to introduce them to aspects of our field with which they might be less familiar. To this end I focused their visit around a tour of departmental laboratories and the Meteorite Gallery, following a brief overview of departmental research activities. The PI’s (Aurnou, Lithgow-Bertelloni, Young) and their graduate students (Xiyuan Bao, Yufan Xu), kindly prepared and ran stimulating presentations, as did Dr. Nicholas Gessler, a docent with the Meteorite Gallery. The three sub-groups of students were shepherded on their rounds by tour-guides: Leslie Instixiengmay, Xuesong Ding, Matthew Bogumil, and Boontigan Kuhasubpasin, who also answered questions regarding the science and the department.\n As one of the guide, Xuesong took some nice photos of this international visit to the KGB Lab, Xiyuan (unluckily got some cold) was the lucky guy to hold the lab visit after Carolina:\n  Xiyuan was introducing mantle plumes using the poster from EYU2019     A visiting student was asking questions to the devices     Xiyuan was introducing the Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (SPIV) system   ","date":1593493870,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593493870,"objectID":"6e3bb1e0c2c50ab3876c6fc5b033cb6c","permalink":"https://xiyuanbao.github.io/kgb/post/jtech2020/","publishdate":"2020-06-29T22:11:10-07:00","relpermalink":"/kgb/post/jtech2020/","section":"post","summary":"Quote from Prof.Lars Stixrude:\n On Feb. 24 Prof. Kenji Ohta of Tokyo Tech visited the EPSS department with 42 students from Tokyo Tech.

More coming soon!\nMotivation\nThis code grew out of an interest in the development of mineralogical Earth models and the exploration of the consequences and predictions of such models for other branches of geophysics. We felt that the large and rapidly growing base of knowledge on the nature of mantle phases and assemblages at high pressure had reached a state that construction of mineralogical Earth models seemed justified. Motivating questions include basic hypothesis tests: Are seismological observations of the mantle consistent with e.g. a lherzolitic composition? How do phase transformations and chemical heterogeneity interact in a convecting system? These have been central questions in the geophysics community for some time, and we felt that a general, flexible, self-consistent thermodynamics code would make a significant contribution towards answering them.\nTheory and capability\nThe theory upon which the code is based has been described and illustrated with applications in previous publications [e.g. Stixrude and Lithgow-Bertelloni, 2005a, 2005b; Xu et al., 2008, Stixrude and Lithgow-Bertelloni, 2011; Stixrude \u0026amp; Lithgow-Bertelloni, 2012 ].\nWe have developed a thermodynamic formulation of mantle assemblages based on the concepts of fundamental thermodynamic relations and Legendre transforms and generalized to conditions of anisotropic stress and strain. For a given pressure, temperature, and bulk composition, the code computes the equilibrium phase assemblage (amounts and compositions of coexisting phases) the equilibrium physical properties of each phase and the assemblage, including but not limited to the density, heat capacity, enthalpy, thermal expansivity, bulk and shear moduli, and P- and S-wave velocities. The Voigt and Reuss bounds, and the Hill average of the moduli and velocities of the assemblage are computed.\nSignificance for the geosciences community\nTwo primary uses of this code would be: 1) As a component of a fully compressible convection code. The code can compute on an arbitrary pressure-temperature-composition grid, all thermodynamic quantities relevant to a convection calculation, including the density and enthalpy, including fully the influence of phase transformations. A lookup table based on the thermodynamics code would be a natural starting point for exploring the dynamics of realistic mantle mineralogical models. 2) Tests of hypothetical models of mantle composition against seismological observations. The crucial feature of our code that will permit central questions to be addressed more convincingly is the self-consistent treatment of phase equilibria and physical properties. To our knowledge, our code is the only one that accomplishes this along with the appropriate anisotropic generalization that is critical for comparison with seismology.\nBenchmarks\nThe code has been tested against a code widely used in shallow mantle and crustal applications: PERPLE_X by Connolly et al. (ETH) [e.g. Connolly, 2005]. In particular, Connolly independently reproduced our published phase diagram of a lherzolitic composition [Stixrude and Lithgow-Bertelloni, 2005a; Stixrude and Lithgow-Bertelloni, 2011].\nCleaning up\nThe code still needs documentation and optimization work. This is an ongoing effort.\nReferences\nConnolly J. A.
