Our research focuses on the connection between Earth’s surface processes and the forces below the surface that drive and shape them. Recently, we reexamined how strong the Earth’s mantle is, and ventured into the connection between thermodynamics and fluid dynamics for our planet. The latter is particularly fascinating as it suggests that the thermodynamics of mantle materials exert a deep control on the thermal and perhaps biological evolution of our planet. We have also developed and applied joint techniques on particle image velocimetry and thermometry to the visualization and understanding of flow in very viscous fluids.\nThe Principal Investigator, Prof.Lithgow-Bertelloni, Carolina, is the Louis B. and Martha B.

She then moved on to a post-doc at Institut für Geophysik, Universität Göttingen, as an NSF postdoctoral fellow, and faculty positions at University of Michigan and University College London.

Upon orphaning, subduction continues uninterrupted through the lateral motion of the parent slab above 660 km depth. In this work, we present a regime diagram for the range of conditions under which slabs can orphan at the top of the lower mantle. Our models show that a viscosity jump at 1,000 km depth not coincident with the endothermic phase change responsible for the 660 km seismic discontinuity, is necessary for orphaning as is the presence of a low viscosity channel between 660 and 1,000 km depth. We show that orphan slabs, similar to other deep slab morphologies, can be the end result for a wide range of physical parameters governing slab dynamics: slab orphaning persists across wide variations in slab dip, slab yield stress/strength, Clapeyron slope values, and overriding plate nature. The diversity in orphan slab sizes and orphaning periods is tied to the orphaning regime space, which describes a hitherto unexplored region between deflected and penetrating deep-subduction modes. Orphaning provides a simple dynamic link between the well-known deflection and penetration, and provides one possible way for slabs to switch from direct penetration to deflection, littering the mantle with abandoned fragments. Orphan slabs are therefore the intermediary between these two extensively studied slab morphologies.","tags":null,"title":"Orphaning Regimes: The Missing Link Between Flattened and Penetrating Slab Morphologies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kiran Chotalia","Neil Cagney","Carolina Lithgow-Bertelloni","John Brodholt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"0c014f5ee55fc44777f78f329d41c65c","permalink":"https://xiyuanbao.github.io/kgb/publication/chotalia-epsl-530-115881-2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-16T00:16:51.995252Z","relpermalink":"/kgb/publication/chotalia-epsl-530-115881-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Water content plays a vital role in determining mantle rheology and thus mantle convection and plate tectonics. Most parameterised convection models predict that Earth initially underwent a period of rapid degassing and heating, followed by a slow and sustained period of regassing and cooling. However, these models assume water is instantaneously mixed and homogeneously distributed into the mantle. This is a limitation because the mixing time for water entering and leaving the mantle is a function of the Rayleigh number which varies dramatically with water content, temperature, and through time. Here we present an adapted parametrised model (Crowley et al., 2011) to include the coupled effects of the time scale of mixing with a water-dependent viscosity. We consider two mixing types: first, where the mixing time is constant throughout the model and second, where mixing time varies as a response to an evolving Rayleigh number. We find that, facilitated by the effects of water content in the melt region at mid-ocean ridges, a constant mixing time can induce long periods of degassing. The inclusion of a variable mixing time dependent on the Rayleigh number acts to limit the period of degassing and also results in more water being stored in the mantle and less at the surface than in both the constant and instantaneous mixing cases. Mixing time cannot be more than 2 billion years as large mixing times trap water in the mantle, leaving a dry surface. Even small changes in the surface ocean induced by mixing times on the order of 0.1 Gyrs can cause changes in the global-mean sea level on the order of 10's of metres. These changes in sea level could easily uncover topographic highs in the bathymetry, potentially aiding sub-aerial erosion a process thought to be important in early Earth evolution. Even in this relatively simple model, the inclusion of a mixing time between water entering and leaving the mantle creates a more dynamic water cycle. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The evolution of its buoyancy and rheology during its lifespan maintains the coherence of the plate as a distinct geological entity and controls the localised deformation and vertical material exchange at plate boundaries, which enables the horizontal ocean-plate movements. These motions intimately link the oceanic plate to the overarching overturn of Earth's mantle: The plate forms out of rising mantle material at spreading ridges; it cools the Earth's interior as the cold thermal boundary layer to mantle convection; and its sinking portions drive not only the plate itself but also dominate global flow in the mantle. We scrutinise here the entire life cycle of the oceanic plate, starting with its birth at the mid-ocean ridge, including the thermal, rheological, and chemical conditions of initiation, followed by plate maturation as it ages and cools while crossing the seafloor, and finishing with the dynamics of plate destruction as it retires at the subduction zone to become a deeper part of Earth's convective system. We find that the full range of dynamic behaviour of the oceanic plate, including its forcing and overall framework within Earth's convecting system, is not fully captured by the existing concept of Plate Tectonics, which describes solely the horizontal surface kinematics of all plates. Therefore, we introduce a more specific and at the same time more integral concept named \"Ocean-Plate Tectonics\" that more specifically describes the dynamic life of the oceanic plate and accounts for the knowledge gained during the past 50 years. This \"Ocean-Plate Tectonics\" must have emerged on Earth at least 1 Billion years ago, and dominates Earth's dynamics today.","tags":null,"title":"The dynamic life of an oceanic plate","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Timezone: EDT\n  ","date":1544630400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544630400,"objectID":"9b63d0977fe3dcb4e90089fcca04e59a","permalink":"https://xiyuanbao.github.io/kgb/talk/birch2018/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/kgb/talk/birch2018/","section":"talk","summary":"The Francis Birch Lecture honors the life and work of Francis Birch, a renowned geophysicist.

Here, we specifically investigate the prominent dynamic interaction of the sinking plate portion with the upper-mantle transition zone and its corresponding surface elevation signal. We unravel, for the first time, that the collision of the sinking slab with the transition zone induces a sudden, dramatic downward tilt of the a upper plate towards the subduction trench. Unraveling this crucial interaction was only possible thanks to state-of-the-art numerical modelling and post-processing. The new model that is introduced here to study the dynamically self-consistent temporal evolution of subduction features accurate subduction-zone topography, robust single-sided plate sinking, stronger plates close to laboratory values, an upper-mantle phase transition, and simple continents at a free surface. To distinguish the impact of the new physical model features, three different setups are used: the simplest model setup includes a basic high-viscosity lower mantle, the second adds a 660-km phase transition, and the third includes, additionally, a continental upper plate. Common to all models is the clear topographic signal upon slab-transition-zone interaction: the upper plate tilts abruptly towards the subduction trench by about 0.05 degrees and over around 10 Ma. This dramatic increase in upper-plate tilt can be related to the slab-induced excitation of the high-viscosity lower mantle, which introduces a wider flow pattern. A large change in horizontal extent of inundation of up to 900 km is observed as a direct consequence of the upper-plate tilting. Such an abrupt variation in surface topography and inundation extent should be clearly visible in temporal records of large-scale surface elevation and might explain continental tilting as observed in Australia since the Eocene and North America during the Phanerozoic.","tags":null,"title":"Abrupt upper-plate tilting during slab-transition-zone collision","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico M.

The discrimination between these two topographic components, however, is difficult to assert. This is because there are still several uncertainties and debates in the geodynamic community, for example, the scales and rates of dynamic topography. Geological, geomorphological, geophysical measurements, and/or landscape analyses might assist to validate models. In this contribution, we provide new geological evidences along the Central and Patagonian Andes, which demonstrate that dynamic topography has been an important component on the South American landscape formation as well as in the ancient western Gondwana. Our examples in the Argentine Pampas show that dynamic topography is required to explain not only the basin subsidence but also the whole observed topography. We also suggest that the dynamic components in this region are much lower than numerical models (average dynamic subsidence rates of similar to 0.04 mm/yr-this work-which contrast with the similar to 0.1 mm/yr estimated in the US). We also propose two strategies to analyze ancient cases. The first requires of comparing a total elevation proxy, like the equilibrium lines (or ELA) in glaciated areas, with model topography derived from geochemical studies of mantle rocks. A second strategy was the analysis of the Triassic rifting evolution of western Argentina (post-rift sag deposits). Sag deposit thicknesses exceed 2 km, which do not correlate with the 100 m thick thermal calculated by rift subsidence modeling.","tags":null,"title":"Mantle Influence on Andean and Pre-Andean Topography","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabio Crameri","Carolina Lithgow-Bertelloni","Paul J.

Distinct vertical surface deflections are particularly apparent at convergent plate boundaries mostly due to the convergence and asymmetric sinking of the plates. Having a mantle convection model with a free surface that is able to reproduce both realistic single-sided subduction and long-wavelength surface topography self-consistently, we are now able to better investigate this interaction. We separate the topographic signal into distinct features and quantify the individual topographic contribution of several controlling subduction parameters. Results are diagnosed by splitting the topographic signal into isostatic and residual components, and by considering various physical aspects like viscous dissipation during plate bending. Performing several systematic suites of experiments, we are then able to quantify the topographic impact of the buoyancy, rheology, and geometry of the subduction-zone system to each and every topographic feature at a subduction zone and to provide corresponding scaling laws. We identify slab dip and, slightly less importantly, slab buoyancy as the major agents controlling surface topography at subduction zones on Earth. Only the island-arc high and the back-arc depression extent are mainly controlled by plate strength. Overall, his modeling study sets the basis to better constrain deep-seated mantle structures and their physical properties via the observed surface topography on present-day Earth and back through time. Plain Language Summary Earth's partially molten mantle flows over millions of years due to the high temperatures, the enormous pressures and the tiny defects in crystals that occur in the Earth's rocky interior. This global flow of mantle material, in particular in regions where cold, heavy plates sink back into the mantle (i.e., subduction), causes visible variations of surface elevation. These topographic variations potentially allow us to better understand the hidden structures and dynamics in Earth's interior. We have developed an efficient model of Earth's interior and can therefore run numerical experiments to better understand this interaction of mantle flow and surface topography. We test the numerous, to some extend still unknown, dynamic, rheologic and geometric properties of subduction zones and quantify their potential to deflect the plate at the surface. We find that the angle of the sinking plates and their relative weight compared to their surrounding have a major control on lifting and depressing the plate surface. Our results will finally allow us to better understand the interior of a planet on present day, but also back through time by simply looking at either the present surface topography or at the available data back through geologic time.","tags":null,"title":"The dynamical control of subduction parameters on surface topography","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Purpose: Compute self-consistently the phase equilibria and equilibrium physical properties of sub-solidus mantle assemblages.\nWhere to find: https://github.com/stixrude/HeFESToRepository\nHow to reference: When using HeFESTo, please cite Stixrude \u0026amp; Lithgow-Bertelloni (2005) or Stixrude \u0026amp; Lithgow-Bertelloni (2011), depending on the application, and, if separate, the paper specifying the parameter set used.

If you have questions contact us at lstixrude@epss.ucla.edu or clb@epss.ucla.edu More coming soon!\nMotivation\nThis code grew out of an interest in the development of mineralogical Earth models and the exploration of the consequences and predictions of such models for other branches of geophysics. We felt that the large and rapidly growing base of knowledge on the nature of mantle phases and assemblages at high pressure had reached a state that construction of mineralogical Earth models seemed justified. Motivating questions include basic hypothesis tests: Are seismological observations of the mantle consistent with e.g. a lherzolitic composition? How do phase transformations and chemical heterogeneity interact in a convecting system? These have been central questions in the geophysics community for some time, and we felt that a general, flexible, self-consistent thermodynamics code would make a significant contribution towards answering them.\nTheory and capability\nThe theory upon which the code is based has been described and illustrated with applications in previous publications [e.g. Stixrude and Lithgow-Bertelloni, 2005a, 2005b; Xu et al., 2008, Stixrude and Lithgow-Bertelloni, 2011; Stixrude \u0026amp; Lithgow-Bertelloni, 2012 ].\nWe have developed a thermodynamic formulation of mantle assemblages based on the concepts of fundamental thermodynamic relations and Legendre transforms and generalized to conditions of anisotropic stress and strain. For a given pressure, temperature, and bulk composition, the code computes the equilibrium phase assemblage (amounts and compositions of coexisting phases) the equilibrium physical properties of each phase and the assemblage, including but not limited to the density, heat capacity, enthalpy, thermal expansivity, bulk and shear moduli, and P- and S-wave velocities. The Voigt and Reuss bounds, and the Hill average of the moduli and velocities of the assemblage are computed.\nSignificance for the geosciences community\nTwo primary uses of this code would be: 1) As a component of a fully compressible convection code. The code can compute on an arbitrary pressure-temperature-composition grid, all thermodynamic quantities relevant to a convection calculation, including the density and enthalpy, including fully the influence of phase transformations. A lookup table based on the thermodynamics code would be a natural starting point for exploring the dynamics of realistic mantle mineralogical models. 2) Tests of hypothetical models of mantle composition against seismological observations. The crucial feature of our code that will permit central questions to be addressed more convincingly is the self-consistent treatment of phase equilibria and physical properties. To our knowledge, our code is the only one that accomplishes this along with the appropriate anisotropic generalization that is critical for comparison with seismology.\nBenchmarks\nThe code has been tested against a code widely used in shallow mantle and crustal applications: PERPLE_X by Connolly et al. (ETH) [e.g. Connolly, 2005]. In particular, Connolly independently reproduced our published phase diagram of a lherzolitic composition [Stixrude and Lithgow-Bertelloni, 2005a; Stixrude and Lithgow-Bertelloni, 2011].\nCleaning up\nThe code still needs documentation and optimization work. This is an ongoing effort.\nReferences\nConnolly J. A.

Here, we investigate the relative amounts of deep and shallow mantle material that are entrained by an ascending plume and constrain its source region. The plumes are generated in a viscous syrup using an isolated heater for a range of Rayleigh numbers. The velocity fields are measured using stereoscopic Particle-Image Velocimetry, and the concept of the 'vortex ring bubble' is used to provide an objective definition of the plume geometry. Using this plume geometry, the plume composition can be analysed in terms of the proportion of material that has been entrained from different depths. We show that the plume composition can be well described using a simple empirical relationship, which depends only on a single parameter, the sampling coefficient, s(c). High-s(c) plumes are composed of material which originated from very deep in the fluid domain, while low-s(c) plumes contain material entrained from a range of depths. The analysis is also used to show that the geometry of the plume can be described using a similarity solution, in agreement with previous studies. Finally, numerical simulations are used to vary both the Rayleigh number and viscosity contrast independently. The simulations allow us to predict the value of the sampling coefficient for mantle plumes; we find that as a plume reaches the lithosphere, 90% of its composition has been derived from the lowermost 260-750 km in the mantle, and negligible amounts are derived from the shallow half of the lower mantle. This result implies that isotope geochemistry cannot provide direct information about this unsampled region, and that the various known geochemical reservoirs must lie in the deepest few hundred kilometres of the mantle.

The experimental model is analogous to a mantle plume rising from the core-mantle boundary to the base of the lithosphere. The behaviour of the plume is studied throughout its life cycle, which is broken up into four stages; the Formation Stage, when the plume forms; the Rising Stage, when the plume rises through the fluid; the Spreading Stage, when the plume reaches the surface and spreads; and finally the Declining Stage, when the heat source has been removed and the plume weakens. The latter three stages are examined in terms of the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent fields and the advection of passive tracers throughout the flow. The temperature at the heater and near the fluid surface are measured using thermocouples to infer how the presence of a mantle plume would produce excess temperature near the lithosphere throughout the various stages of its life cycle. In all experiments, a time lag is observed between the removal of the heat source and the decline in the excess temperature near the surface, which is proportional to the rise time. A simple analytical model is presented, which suggests that under mantle conditions (i.e. negligible thermal diffusion), the relationship between the time lag and the rise time is robust and independent of the Rayleigh number; however, the constant of proportionality is closer to unity in the absence of diffusion. Once the heat source is removed, the excess temperature near the surface declines exponentially at a rate that is inversely proportional to the rise time. The implications of this result are discussed in terms of the decline in volcanism in the Louisville hotspot chain over the past 20 Ma. The rise velocity of material in the plume is examined; the rise velocity is found to vary significantly with the plume height in a manner that is inconsistent with many of the common semi-analytical models of thermal plumes in the literature. It is also argued that this height dependency will cause estimates of the rise velocity based on the decay series of uranium isotopes to significantly underestimate the true value.","tags":null,"title":"Dynamics and excess temperature of a plume throughout its life cycle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John-Michael Kendall","Carolina Lithgow-Bertelloni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"ad4ced7964e291335d9bc4bf2962712d","permalink":"https://xiyuanbao.github.io/kgb/publication/kendall-mrav-420-11-2016/","publishdate":"2020-07-16T00:16:52.005713Z","relpermalink":"/kgb/publication/kendall-mrav-420-11-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Continental rifting has a fundamental role in the tectonic behaviour of the Earth, shaping the surface we live on. Although there is not yet a consensus about the dominant mechanism for rifting, there is a general agreement that the stresses required to rift the continental lithosphere are not readily available. Here we use a global finite element model of the lithosphere to calculate the stresses acting on Africa. We consider the stresses induced by mantle flow, crustal structure and topography in two types of models: one in which flow is exclusively driven by the subducting slabs and one in which it is derived from a shear wave tomographic model. The latter predicts much larger stresses and a more realistic dynamic topography. It is therefore clear that the mantle structure beneath Africa plays a key part in providing the radial and horizontal tractions, dynamic topography and gravitational potential energy necessary for rifting. Nevertheless, the total available stress (c. 100 MPa) is much less than that needed to break thick, cold continental lithosphere. Instead, we appeal to a model of magma-assisted rifting along pre-existing weaknesses, where the strain is localized in a narrow axial region and the strength of the plate is reduced significantly.

The mechanism is dynamic deflection: the sinking of dense subducted lithosphere gives rise to stresses that directly pull down the surface. Here we show that subduction does not always lead to downward deflections of the Earth's surface. Subduction of young lithosphere at shallow angles (flat subduction) leaves it neutrally or even positively buoyant with respect to underlying mantle because the lithosphere is relatively warm compared with older lithosphere, and because the thickened and hence drier oceanic crust does not undergo the transformation of basalt to denser eclogite. Accounting for neutrally buoyant flat segments along with large variations in slab morphology in the South American subduction zone explains along-strike and temporal changes in dynamic topography observed in the geologic record since the beginning of the Cenozoic.

We investigate this problem by studying the dynamics of an active region of flat-slab subduction located in Peru in South America. Here the slab geometry is well known, based on the regional seismicity, and we have observations from the local geological record to validate our models. Of particular interest is the widespread subsidence and deposition of the Solimoes Formation across western Amazonia that coincided with the development of the Peruvian flat-slab during the Mid-Late Miocene. This formation covers an extensive area from the foredeep to the Purus Arch located similar to 2000 km away from the trench. Close to the Andes the preservation of several kilometers of sedimentary thicknesses can be easily accounted for by flexure. Based on an estimate of the Andean loading we predict 2.8 to 3.6 km of accommodation space that spans 100 km. The spatial and temporal history of the Solimoes Formation however, particularly the thick distal foreland accumulations up to 1.2 km deep, can only be matched with the addition of a longer-wavelength dynamic source of topography. Following the transition from normal to flat subduction, we predict over 1 km of dynamic subsidence (similar to 1500 km wide) that propagates over 1000 km away from the trench, tracking the subduction leading edge. This is followed by a pulse of dynamic uplift over the flat segment behind it. We therefore propose that a combination of uplift, flexure and dynamic topography during slab flattening in Peru is responsible for the sedimentation history and landscape evolution of western Amazonia that eventually led to the configuration of the Amazon Drainage Basin we know today.

The experiments show that the decollement slope (beta) is the key factor in controlling the location of thrust initiation with respect to the backstop (i.e. tectonic suture line). For beta = 0, the ramping begins right at the backstop, followed by sequential thrusting in the frontal direction, leading to a typical mono-vergent wedge. In contrast, the ramp initiates away from the backstop as beta  0. Under this boundary condition an event of sequential back thrusting takes place prior to the onset of frontal thrust progression.

For Ra  20 000, temperature increases above the hot bottom and forms a rising plume head. The head has small internal recirculation and minor outward conduction of heat during ascent. The head approaches the top, flattens, splits and the two remnants are swept to the sidewalls and diffused away. The maximum velocity and the top centre heat flux climb to maxima during head ascent and then adjust toward constant values. Two steady cells are separated by a vertical thermal conduit. This sequence is followed for every value of Pr number, although lower Pr convection lags in time.

However, at other hotspot provinces such as the Galapagos, Nazca Ridge, and Louisville the lower crust is intruded by large volumes of gabbroic (mafic) rocks (Vp similar to 6.8-7.5 km/s). Ultramafic primary melts formed beneath mature oceanic lithosphere at pressures of similar to 2-3 GPa (60-90 km depth), and ponded at the Moho due to their relatively high density, can explain the observed ultramafic deep-crustal bodies. By contrast, plume melts formed at depths of similar to 15-30 km beneath thin lithosphere crystallize assemblages that are more gabbroic. The velocity and density gradient is particularly strong in the pressure range 0.6-1.5 GPa due to the replacement of plagioclase by olivine as melts become more MgO-rich with increasing pressure (and degree) of melting. This anomalous density gradient suggests a possible filtering effect whereby plume melts equilibrated at relatively shallow depths beneath very young and thin oceanic lithosphere may be expected to be of nearly gabbroic (mafic) composition (similar to 6-10% MgO), whereas ultramafic melts (MgO similar to 12-20%) formed beneath older, thicker oceanic lithosphere must pond and undergo extensive olivine and clinopyroxene fractionation before evolving residual magmas of basaltic composition sufficiently buoyant to be erupted at the surface. A survey of well-studied hotspot provinces of highly-varying lithospheric age at the time of emplacement shows that deep-crustal and upper mantle seismic refraction data are consistent with this hypothesis. These results highlight the importance of large-volume intrusive processes in the evolution of hotspot magmas, with intrusive volumes being significantly larger than those of the erupted lavas in most cases. Pyrolite melting can account, to first order, for the total crustal column of magmatic products, whereas alternative models such as selective melting of pyroxenite blobs probably cannot.","tags":null,"title":"Petrological interpretation of deep crustal intrusive bodies beneath oceanic hotspot provinces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mainak Mookherjee","Bijay B.

The relationship between the lithosphere's isostatic state, subcrustal structure and stress field, however, remains unresolved due to the uncertainties on its thickness, composition and rheology. To study the influence of lithospheric structure on intraplate stresses, we use a new model of global lithospheric structure (TDL) that accounts for the presence of depleted mantle to explore the effects of isostatic compensation, mantle density structure, lithospheric thickness (base depth) and mechanical coupling within the lithosphere on wavelengths 200 km. We compute the mean lithostatic stress (O) of 2 degrees x 2 degrees lithospheric columns and then solve for the resulting global tectonic stress field for a homogeneous elastic lithosphere with the finite element package ABAQUS. For a 100 km base depth, a historically common value for lithospheric thickness, tectonic stress patterns are largely insensitive to mantle density structure and match patterns in the world stress map, for both isostatically compensanted and non-compensated lithospheric structure. Increasing the base depth up to 250 km to account for thick continental roots, however, leads to sharp variations in the stress field between isostatic lithospheric structure models and TDL as the mantle portion of the lithosphere dominates O. Decreasing the model base depths up to 25 km as a proxy for vertical strength variations due to low viscosity channels within the crust or lithosphere as a whole, strongly alters stresses in magnitude, azimuth and regime, as the influence of topography and shallow crustal structure increases. We find that restricting spatial changes in O to a specified region to mimic lateral variations in strength also has a large effect on the resulting stresses, which leads us to conclude that regional models may not always be adequate for modelling the stress field. Strong deviations from long-wavelength patterns on the world stress map in models with a shallow (150 km) uncompensated model base depth likely reflect that the globally averaged lithospheric thickness is close to 100 km and large deviations from this depth generate unrealistic stress patterns related to uncompensated buoyancy forces. Because the stresses are so sensitive to base depth, we conclude that using O to represent spatial and vertical variations in lithospheric structure is not an adequate approximation. Our results suggest that future studies must incorporate the full 3-D variations in density and rheology of the lithosphere to elucidate the source and nature of the lithospheric stress field. These studies have become possible with the advent of modern computational tools and advances in our knowledge of lithospheric structure and rheology.","tags":null,"title":"The effects of lithospheric thickness and density structure on Earth's stress field","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joost van Summeren","Clinton P.

To investigate the relative importance of plausible controls, we predicted global patterns of plate motions using numerical models that incorporate the influence of subducting slabs, convective mantle flow, and continental roots. From the mantle convection models, we computed a set of dynamically consistent plate velocities by balancing forces that drive and resist the motion of each plate. When deep continental roots anchor to the sub-asthenospheric upper mantle, the calculated patterns of plate motions are close to the observations if only similar to 20% of (excess) upper mantle slab weight contributes to the slab pull force. However, this small contribution causes plates to move too slowly on average unless mantle viscosity is a factor of similar to 2 lower than expected from post-glacial rebound. In contrast, we show that predicted and observed plate motions are more easily reconciled if even the deepest continental roots are underlain by a low-viscosity layer and at least half of (excess) upper mantle slab weight contributes to the slab pull force. This preferred scenario agrees with recent seismological evidence for a global asthenosphere and previously proposed mechanisms for partial decoupling of slabs from surface plates.","tags":null,"title":"The importance of slab pull and a global asthenosphere to plate motions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lars Stixrude","Carolina Lithgow-Bertelloni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"38d72267ee334f7edf79d4fc74653469","permalink":"https://xiyuanbao.github.io/kgb/publication/stixrude-gji-184-1180-2011/","publishdate":"2020-07-16T00:16:52.018478Z","relpermalink":"/kgb/publication/stixrude-gji-184-1180-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"PWe complete the development and description of a thermodynamic method for the computation of phase equilibria and physical properties of multiphase mantle assemblages.

Bouguer anomalies and flexural analysis predict a foredeep of similar to 250 km width and a peripheral bulge amplitude of similar to 25 m, which match the regional morphologies of the modern Argentine Pampean Plain.

Stirring times of the mantle are too long to allow for complete re-homogenization of subducted basalt and harzburgite, given the low chemical diffusivity of the solid mantle. This Suggests that the Earth's mantle is a mechanical mixture of basaltic and harzburgitic components. Using a recently developed thermodynamic formulism we determine the phase equilibria and the seismic properties of a mantle comprised of a mechanical mixture of basalt and harzburgite (MM) and a homogeneous mantle (EA) with identical pyrolitic bulk chemistry. We use the theoretical shear velocity profiles as a new thermometer of the mantle below the magma-genetic zone by modeling the difference Delta T410-660 between traveltimes of shear wave reflections off the 410-km and 660-km with the potential temperature T-p. Delta T410-660 are measured from waveform stacks. They indicate that, over 1000+ km wave lengths, the temperature varies by about 200 K. Lowest and highest temperatures are resolved for the western Pacific subduction zones and the central Pacific, respectively. This variation is similar for the EA and MM and is in excellent agreement with estimates of transition zone thickness and shear velocity variations. The median value of T-p for the EA is 1720 K. It is about 1625 K for the MM, a value that is in better agreement with the Normal-MORB values of 1610 +/- 40 K inferred from olivine-liquid equilibria given that our sampling region encompasses the Western Pacific subduction zones and the oldest parts of the Pacific Plate.

In particular, elastic properties are computed with a recent self-consistent thermodynamic model, based on a six oxides (NCFMAS) system. We focus on average structure between 250 and 800 km. We invert normal modes eigenfrequencies and traveltimes to obtain best-fitting average thermal structures for various compositional profiles. The thermochemical structures are then used to predict long-period waveforms, SS precursors waveforms and radial profiles of attenuation. These examples show the potential of our procedure to refine the interpretation combining different data sets. We found that a mixture of MORB and Harzburgite, with the MORB component increasing with depth, is able to reproduce well all the seismic data for realistic thermal structures. If the proportions of MORB with depth do not change, unrealistic negative thermal gradients below 250 km would be necessary to explain the data. Equilibrium assemblages, such as pyrolite, cannot fit the seismic data. The elastic velocities predicted by the reference mineral physics model tested are too low at the top of the lower mantle, even for the fastest (and most depleted) composition, that is, harzburgite. An increase in V-P of 1 per cent and in V-S of 2 per cent improves the data fit significantly and is required to find models that fit both traveltimes and normal modes, indicating the need for further experimental measurements of these properties at the simultaneously elevated pressure-temperature conditions of the lower mantle. Extending our procedure to other seismic and density data and interpreting the 3-D structure holds promise to further improve our knowledge of the thermochemical structure of the upper mantle.

We show that the contribution from phase transformations is comparable in magnitude to that of temperature alone, and has important consequences for mantle structure. Both scalings are highly non-linear functions of temperature and depth even in the elastic limit due to the influence of phase transitions: near sharp phase transitions seismic velocities become much more sensitive to temperature.

If mantle heat sources are known, surface heat flow at different times may be used to deduce the efficiency of convective cooling and ultimately the temporal character of plate tectonics. We estimate global heat flow from 65 Ma to the present using seafloor age reconstructions and a modified half-space cooling model, and we find that heat flow has decreased by similar to 0.15% every million years during the Cenozoic. By examining geometric trends in plate reconstructions since 120 Ma, we show that the reduction in heat flow is due to a decrease in the area of ridge-proximal oceanic crust. Even accounting for uncertainties in plate reconstructions, the rate of heat flow decrease is an order of magnitude faster than estimates based on smooth, parameterized cooling models. This implies that heat flow experiences short-term fluctuations associated with plate tectonic cyclicity. Continental separation does not appear to directly control convective wavelengths, but rather indirectly affects how oceanic plate systems adjust to accommodate global heat transport. Given that today's heat flow may be unusually low, secular cooling rates estimated from present-day values will tend to underestimate the average cooling rate. Thus, a mechanism that causes less efficient tectonic heat transport at higher temperatures may be required to prevent an unreasonably hot mantle in the recent past.","tags":null,"title":"Time variability in Cenozoic reconstructions of mantle heat flow: Plate tectonic cycles and implications for Earth's thermal evolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiqiao Xu","Carolina Lithgow-Bertelloni","Clinton P.

However, given the near-constancy of surface velocities within a tectonic stage, we can estimate Cenozoic plate ages, even for subducted lithosphere. We reconstruct seafloor ages based on the Cenozoic plate reconstructions and absolute rotation poles of Gordon and Jurdy [R.G. Gordon and D.M. Jurdy, Cenozoic Global Plate Motions, J. Geophys.

These changes in sea level occur despite decreases in oceanic lithosphere production rates of only about 20% in both models. Thus, the changing distribution of seafloor age has a larger effect on sea level than changes in spreading rates or ridge lengths.

However, associations between stress changes and locations of small aftershocks are typically difficult because of large errors on offshore aftershock locations based on land-based seismic observations. After the 1999 Quepos earthquake (M-w=6.9) in the subduction zone offshore Costa Rica, small magnitude earthquakes were located using a local onshore-offshore temporary seismic network, providing a data set of high-quality aftershock locations. In light of these well-located aftershocks, we compute Coulomb stress changes for the 1999 Quepos earthquake for comparison.

The theory differs from previous treatments in being thermodynamically self-consistent: the theory is based on the concept of fundamental thermodynamic relations appropriately generalized to anisotropic strain and in encompassing elasticity in addition to the usual isotropic thermodynamic properties. In this first paper, we present the development of the theory, discuss its scope, and focus on its application to physical properties of mantle phases at elevated pressure and temperature including the equation of state, thermochernical properties and the elastic wave velocities. We find that the Eulerian finite strain formulation captures the variation of the elastic moduli with compression. The variation of the vibrational frequencies with compression is also cast as a Taylor series expansion in the Eulerian finite strain, the appropriate volume derivative of which leads to an expression for the Gruneisen parameter that agrees well with results from first principles theory. For isotropic materials, the theory contains nine material-specific parameters: the values at ambient conditions of the Helmholtz free energy, volume, bulk and shear moduli, their pressure derivatives, an effective Debye temperature, its first and second logarithmic volume derivatives (gamma(o), q(0)), and the shear strain derivative of gamma. We present and discuss in some detail the results of a global inversion of a wide variety of experimental data and first principles theoretical results, supplemented by systematic relations, for the values of these parametersfor 31 mantle species. Among our findings is that the value of q is likely to be significantly greater than unity for most mantle species. We apply the theory to the computation of the shear wave velocity, and temperature and compositional (Fe content) derivatives at relevant mantle pressure temperature conditions. Among the patterns that emerge is that garnet is anomalous in being remarkably insensitive to iron content or temperature as compared with other mantle phases.","tags":null,"title":"Thermodynamics of mantle minerals - I.

The Grenville Province in this area is characterized by synorogenic extension at ca. 1040 Ma, supported by U-Pb data on titanites and Ar-40-Ar-39 data on hornblendes, followed by regional extension occurring along crustal-scale shear zones between 945 and 780 Ma, as recorded by Ar-40-Ar-39 analysis of hornblende, biotite, and K-feldspar. By ca. 780 Ma the southern portion of the Grenville Province, from Ontario to the Adirondack Highlands, underwent uplift as a uniform block. Tectonic hypotheses have invoked various driving mechanisms to explain the transition from compression to extension; however, such explanations are thus far geodynamically unconstrained. Numerical models indicate that mechanisms such as gravitational collapse and mantle delamination act over timescales that cannot explain a protracted 300 m.y. extensional history that is contemporaneous with ongoing uplift of the Grenville Province. Rather, the presence of a plume upwelling underneath the Laurentian margin, combined with changes in regional stress directions, permitted the observed uplift and extension in the Grenville Province during this time. The uplift history, while on a slightly different timescale from those of most plume models, is similar to that seen in models of uplift and extension caused by the interaction of a plume with the base of the lithosphere. Some of the protracted extension likely reflects the contribution of far-field effects, possibly caused by tectonic activity in other cratons within the Rodinian supercontinent, effectively changing the stress distributions in the Grenville Province of northeastern North America.","tags":null,"title":"Exhumation of a collisional orogen: A perspective from the North American Grenville Province","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Clinton P.

Strong locking, or 'seismic coupling', of the interface between plates at certain subduction zones is often invoked to explain these great earthquakes. Although past studies have correlated strong seismic coupling with a compressional stress environment that is characterized by back-arc compression and caused by trenchward motion of the overriding plate, the consequences of this compressional environment for the tectonic forces that drive global plate motions are not yet clear. To examine these consequences, we compared subduction zone earthquake magnitudes to tectonically constrained estimates of the degree to which each slab transmits its excess weight as a direct pull force on a subducting plate. At seismically uncoupled subduction zones that generate only moderate-sized earthquakes, we find that slabs must transmit nearly their entire upper mantle weight as a pull force on the subducting plate. At seismically coupled subduction zones that produce great earthquakes, however, we find that slabs must be nearly completely detached from their subducting plates. This suggests that slabs subducting in a compressional environment experience stress-induced weakening that prevents the effective transmission of the slab pull force. Convergent mantle flow above a descending slab that becomes decoupled from its surface plate may induce additional surface compression that further locks the subduction zone and leads to additional slab decoupling and detachment. The resulting redistribution of plate-driving forces may be responsible for rapid changes in plate motion. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We calculate the nonisostatic topography of the North Atlantic by correcting seafloor depths for lithospheric cooling and sediment loading, and find that seafloor west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is an average of 0.5 km deeper than it is to the east. We are able to reproduce this basic observation in a model of mantle flow driven by tomographically inferred mantle densities.

Our model also predicts dynamic support of observed topographic highs near Iceland and the Azores, but suggests that the Icelandic high is due to local upper-mantle upwelling, while the Azores high is part of a plate-scale lower-mantle upwelling to the south. An anomalously deep area off the coast of Nova Scotia may be associated with the downwelling component of edge-driven convection at the continental boundary.

In an effort to elucidate the origin of the present state of stress of the lithosphere we use a finite element model of the Earth's lithosphere to calculate stresses induced by mantle flow, crustal heterogeneity, and topography and compare these to observations of intraplate stresses as given by the World Stress Map. We explore two models of lithospheric heterogeneity, one based directly on seismic and other observational constraints ( Crust 2.0), and another that assumes isostatic compensation. Mantle tractions are computed from two models of mantle density heterogeneity: a model based on the history of subduction of the last 180 Myr, which has proved successful at accurately reproducing the present-day geoid and Cenozoic plate velocities, and a model inferred from seismic tomography. We explore the effects of varying assumptions for the viscosity structure of the mantle, and the effects of lateral variations in viscosity in the form of weak plate boundaries. We find that a combined model that includes both mantle and lithospheric sources of stress yields the best match to the observed stress field ( similar to 60% variance reduction), although there are many regions where agreement between observed and predicted stresses is poor. The stress field produced by mantle tractions alone shows a greater degree of long-wavelength structure than is apparent in the stress observations but agrees very well with observations in some areas where radial mantle tractions are particularly strong such as in southeast Asia and the western Pacific. The stress field produced by lithospheric heterogeneity alone depends strongly on the assumed crustal model: Whereas the isostatically compensated model yields very poor agreement with observations, the model based on Crust 2.0 matches the observations about as well as mantle tractions alone and matches very well in certain areas where the influence of high topography is very important ( e. g., Andes, East Africa). A possible interpretation of our results is that the stress field is significantly influenced by lateral variations in the viscosity of the mantle, which leads to variable amounts of decoupling between lithosphere and mantle, allowing the mantle signature to dominate in some areas and the crustal signature to dominate in others. The poor fit between the isostatically compensated crustal model and observations and the large differences between the two crustal models point toward the importance of dynamic topography and remaining uncertainties in crustal structure and rheology. We also consider the possibility that observations of stress from the shallow crust may not reflect the state of stress of the entire plate; stresses in the upper plate may be at least partially decoupled from broader- scale plate driving forces by lateral and vertical variations in lithospheric rheology.","tags":null,"title":"Origin of the lithospheric stress field","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Clinton P.

A detached slab descending through the mantle will excite mantle flow that exerts shear tractions on the base of the surface plates. This \"slab suction'' force drives subducting and overriding plates symmetrically toward subduction zones. Alternatively, cold, strong slabs may effectively transmit stresses to subducting surface plates, exerting a direct \"slab pull'' force on these plates, drawing them rapidly toward subduction zones. This motion induces mantle flow that pushes overriding plates away from subduction zones. We constrain the relative importance of slab suction and slab pull by comparing Cenozoic plate motions to model predictions that include viscous mantle flow and a proxy for slab strength. We find that slab pull from upper mantle slabs combined with slab suction from lower mantle slabs explains the observation that subducting plates currently move similar to4 times faster than nonsubducting plates. This implies that upper mantle slabs are strong enough to support their own weight. Slab suction and slab pull presently account for about 40 and 60% of the forces on plates, but slab suction only similar to30% if a low-viscosity asthenosphere decouples plates from mantle flow. The importance slab pull has been increasing steadily through the Cenozoic because the mass and length of upper mantle slabs has been increasing. This causes subducting plates to double their speed relative to nonsubducting plates during this time period.

The experimental tank (1 x 1 x 0.3 m) is heated from below with insulating top and side boundaries, so that the fluid experiences secular heating as experiments proceed. This setup allows a focused study of thermal plumes from the bottom boundary layer over a range of Rayleigh numbers relevant to convective plumes in the deep interior of the Earth's mantle. The effective value of Ra, based on the viscosity of the fluid at the interior temperature, varies from 10(5) at the beginning to almost 10(8) toward the end of the experiments. Thermals (plumes) from the lower boundary layer are trailed by continuous conduits with long residence times. Plumes dominate flow in the tank, although there is a weaker large-scale circulation induced by material cooling at the imperfectly insulating top and sidewalls. At large Ra convection is extremely time-dependent and exhibits episodic bursts of plumes, separated by periods of quiescence. This bursting behaviour probably results from the inability of the structure of the thermal boundary layer and its instabilities to keep pace with the rate of secular change in the value of Ra. The frequency of plumes increases and their size decreases with increasing Ra, and we characterize these changes via in situ thermocouple measurements, shadowgraph videos, and videos of liquid crystal films recorded during several experiments. A scaling analysis predicts observed changes in plume head and tail radii with increasing Ra. Since inertial effects are largely absent no transition to 'hard' thermal turbulence is observed, in contrast to a previous conclusion from numerical calculations at similar Rayleigh numbers. We suggest that bursting behaviour similar to that observed may occur in the Earth's mantle as it undergoes secular cooling on the billion-year time scale.","tags":null,"title":"Plume generation in natural thermal convection at high Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul G.

But the origin of certain large-scale features, such as the anomalous elevation of the southern and eastern African plateaux, has remained controversial. Whereas the average elevation of most cratons is between 400 and 500 m, the southern African plateau stands more than 1 km above sea level, with the surrounding oceans possessing a residual bathymetry in excess of 500 m (ref. 4). Global seismic tomography studies have persistently indicated the existence of a large-scale low-velocity anomaly beneath the African plate(5-10) and here we show that mantle flow induced by the density variations inferred from these velocity anomalies can dynamically support the excess elevation of the African 'superswell'.

A fuller understanding, however, can be derived from consideration of the history of plate motions. Here we investigate the kinematics of the last 120 Myr of plate motions and the dynamics of Cenozoic motions, paying special attention to changes in the character of plate motions and plate-driving forces. We analyze the partitioning of the observed surface velocity field into toroidal (transform/spin) and poloidal (spreading/subduction) motions. The present-day field is not equipartitioned in poloidal and toroidal components; toroidal motions account for only one third of the total. The toroidal/poloidal ratio has changed substantially in the last 120 Myr with poloidal motion decreasing significantly after 43 Ma while toroidal motion remains essentially constant; this result is not explained by changes in plate geometry alone. We develop a self-consistent model of plate motions by (1) constructing a straightforward model of mantle density heterogeneity based largely upon subduction history and then (2) calculating the induced plate motions for each stage of the Cenozoic. The \"slab\" heterogeneity model compares rather well with seismic heterogeneity models, especially away from the thermochemical boundary layers near the surface and core-mantle boundary. The slab model predicts the observed geoid extremely well, although comparison between predicted and observed dynamic topography is ambiguous. The midmantle heterogeneities that explain much of the observed seismic heterogeneity and geoid are derived largely from late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic subduction, when subduction rates were much higher than they are at present. The plate motion model itself successfully predicts Cenozoic plate motions (global correlations of 0.7-0.9) for mantle viscosity structures that are consistent with a variety of geophysical studies.

We assume that slabs cross the upper/lower mantle interface and continue sinking into the lower mantle with a reduced velocity. For a velocity reduction factor between 2 and 5, our slab heterogeneity model is as correlated with current tomographic models as these models are correlated with each other. We have also computed a synthetic geoid from our density model. For a viscosity increase of about a factor of 40 from the upper to lower mantle, our model predicts the first 8 spherical harmonic degrees of the geoid with statistical confidence larger than 95% and explains 84% of the observed geoid assuming that the model C21 and S21 terms are absent due to a long relaxation time for Earth's rotational bulge. Otherwise, 73% of the geoid variance is explained. The viscosity increase is consistent with our velocity reduction factor for slabs entering the lower mantle, since downwelling velocities are expected to scale roughly as the logarithm of viscosity (log(e) 40 = 3.7). These results show that the history of plate tectonics can explain the main features of the present-day structure of the mantle. The dynamic topography induced by this heterogeneity structure consists mainly of about 1-km amplitude lows concentrated along the active continental margins of the Pacific basin.

We have investigated the recent evolution of plate tectonics by examining the history of toroidal-poloidal partitioning of plate motions. Taking into account estimated errors, our results suggest a significant increase in the ratio of toroidal to poloidal motions postdating the Hawaiian-Emperor (H-E) bend at 43 Ma, corresponding to an overall decrease in global plate motions. These changes may reflect greater mantle plume activity in the Mesozoic, but a causal mechanism is not obvious. In general, observed Cenozoic and Mesozoic plate motions do not appear to be random, which implies that they are correlated. We also find perhaps three significant changes in net rotation of the lithosphere with respect to hotspots since 120 Ma.","tags":null,"title":"Toroidal-poloidal partitioning of plate motions since 120 ma","type":"publication"}]
