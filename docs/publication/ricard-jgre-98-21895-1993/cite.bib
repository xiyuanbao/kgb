 abstract = {Using Cenozoic and Mesozoic plate motion reconstructions,
we derive a model of present-day mantle density heterogeneity
under the assumption that subducted slabs sink vertically into the
mantle. The thermal buoyancy of these slabs is estimated from the
observed thermal subsidence (cooling) of oceanic lithosphere. Slab
velocities in the upper mantle are computed from the local
convergence rate. We assume that slabs cross the upper/lower
mantle interface and continue sinking into the lower mantle with a
reduced velocity. For a velocity reduction factor between 2 and 5,
our slab heterogeneity model is as correlated with current
tomographic models as these models are correlated with each other.
We have also computed a synthetic geoid from our density model.
For a viscosity increase of about a factor of 40 from the upper to
lower mantle, our model predicts the first 8 spherical harmonic
degrees of the geoid with statistical confidence larger than 95%
and explains 84% of the observed geoid assuming that the model C21
and S21 terms are absent due to a long relaxation time for Earth's
rotational bulge. Otherwise, 73% of the geoid variance is
explained. The viscosity increase is consistent with our velocity
reduction factor for slabs entering the lower mantle, since
downwelling velocities are expected to scale roughly as the
logarithm of viscosity (log(e) 40 = 3.7). These results show that
the history of plate tectonics can explain the main features of
the present-day structure of the mantle. The dynamic topography
induced by this heterogeneity structure consists mainly of about
1-km amplitude lows concentrated along the active continental
margins of the Pacific basin. Our model can also be used to
predict the time variation of mantle heterogeneity and the gravity
field. We find that the ''age'' of the geoid, defined as the time
in the past before which the geoid becomes uncorrelated with the
present geoid, is about 50 iii.y. Our model for the history of the
degree 2 geoid, which is equivalent to the history of the inertia
tensor, should give us a tool to study the variations in Earth's
rotation pole indicated in paleomagnetic studies.},
