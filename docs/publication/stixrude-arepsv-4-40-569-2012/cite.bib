 abstract = {Chemical heterogeneity, produced by the near-surface rock
cycle and dominated volumetrically by subducted oceanic crust and
its depleted residue, is continuously subducted into the mantle.
This lithologic-scale chemical heterogeneity may survive in the
mantle for as long as the age of Earth because chemical diffusion
is inefficient. Estimates of rates of subduction and mantle
processing over geologic history indicate that most or all of the
mantle may be composed of lithologically heterogeneous material.
Mineralogical models of the mantle show that chemical
heterogeneity over many decades in length scale may be detectable
by geophysical probes via its influence on seismic-wave
propagation. Grain-scale heterogeneity influences the aggregate
absolute seismic velocity and its lateral variation with
temperature. The elastic-wave velocity contrast associated with
lithologic-scale heterogeneity may be sufficient to produce
observable scattering of short-period seismic waves.},
