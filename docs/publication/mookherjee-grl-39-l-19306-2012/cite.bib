 abstract = {The new aluminous (NAL) phase and aluminous phase with
calcium ferrite (CF) structure constitutes more than 25 volume %
of the deeply subducted crust at lower mantle depths. Using first
principle simulations, we calculate the energetics, equation of
state, and elasticity of NAL phase with a widely varying
composition including CaMg2Al6O12, NaNa2Al3Si3O12 and
KNa2Al3Si3O12. Our calculations indicate the relative stability of
NAL and CF phases is a sensitive function of pressure,
temperature, and composition, with increasing pressure tending to
favor the CF phase, and increasing temperature, Mg-content and
alkali-content tending to favor the NAL phase. The sound wave
velocities of the NAL phase is significantly lower than CF phases
and other major lower mantle phases. In deeply subducted MORB and
CC, the faster sound velocity of silica (SiO2) and its
high-pressure polymorphic phase is likely to be compensated with
the slower sound wave velocities of NAL phase. Citation:
