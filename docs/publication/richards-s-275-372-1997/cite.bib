 abstract = {Paleomagnetic data show less than similar to 1000
kilometers of motion between the paleomagnetic and hotspot
reference frames-that is, true polar wander-during the past 100
million years, which implies that Earth's rotation axis has been
very stable. This long-term rotational stability can be explained
by the slow rate ol change in the large-scale pattern of plate
tectonic motions during Cenozoic and late Mesozoic time, provided
that subducted lithosphere is a major component of the mantle
density heterogeneity generated by convection. Therefore, it is
unnecessary to invoke other mechanisms, such as sluggish
readjustment of the rotational bulge, to explain the observed low
rate of true polar wander.},
