 abstract = {This is a Reply to Hechenleitner and collaborators Comment,
who proposed a Cretaceous age for the whole Llanos Formation
(central Argentina, Sierras Pampeanas Province), based on
neosauropod fossils, instead of Miocene as originally proposed by
Ezpeleta et al. (2006) and Davila et al. (2007). However, red beds
that underlay the thick paleosoils of the Llanos Formation
provided nine detrital U-Pb Paleogene (62 Ma, earliest Cenozoic)
ages on zircon grains (Astini et al., 2009; Ezpeleta 2009). On the
base of this evidence, and other mammal remnant within the Sierras
Pampeanas (where the Llanos Formation develops), we proposed this
is a condensed unit with Mesozoic ages at the bottom and
Mio-Pliocene (likely younger) to the top. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
