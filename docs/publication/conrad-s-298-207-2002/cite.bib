 abstract = {The gravitational pull of subducted slabs is thought to
drive the motions of Earth's tectonic plates, but the coupling
between slabs and plates is not well established. If a slab is
mechanically attached to a subducting plate, it can exert a direct
pull on the plate. Alternatively, a detached slab may drive a
plate by exciting flow in the mantle that exerts a shear traction
on the base of the plate. From the geologic history of subduction,
we estimated the relative importance of "pull" versus "suction"
for the present-day plates. Observed plate motions are best
predicted if slabs in the upper mantle are attached to plates and
generate slab pull forces that account for about half of the total
driving force on plates. Slabs in the lower mantle are supported
by viscous mantle forces and drive plates through slab suction.},
