 abstract = {The determination of Earth's gravity field has benefited
from various gravity missions that have been launched recently
(CHAMP and GRACE) and a new quantitative jump should be made by
the GOCE mission in a few more years. For the first time, a global
high-quality coverage of the Earth's gravity is available. In this
paper, we review the results that have been obtained to explain
Earth's gravity on a global scale. We show how we can separate the
contributions due to shallow density variations (crust and
lithosphere) to those related to the deep mantle. The geoid (or
the first degrees of the gravity field) is very simply and well
explained by ancient slabs subducting throughout the whole mantle.
Such a density distribution is in agreement with tomographic
results and qualitatively with what is expected from a convective
mantle without a large amount of bottom heating. Although we can
produce a simple model that correlates with observations for all
degrees and explain most of the geoid, a significant improvement
in the fit is possible and will need to take into account the
details of the lithospheric structure.},
