 abstract = {Although subducting slabs undergo a bending deformation
that resists tectonic plate motions, the magnitude of this
resistance is not known because of poor constraints on slab
strength. However, because slab bending slows the relatively rapid
motions of oceanic plates, observed plate motions constrain the
importance of bending. We estimated the slab pull force and the
bending resistance globally for 207 subduction zone transects
using new measurements of the bending curvature determined from
slab seismicity. Predicting plate motions Using a global mantle
flow model, we constrain the viscosity of the bending slab to be
at most similar to 300 times more viscous than the upper mantle:
stronger slabs are intolerably slowed by the bending deformation.
Weaker slabs, however, cannot transmit a pull force sufficient to
explain rapid trenchward plate motions unless slabs stretch faster
than seismically observed rates of similar to 10(-15) s(-1). The
constrained bending viscosity (similar to 2 x 10(23) Pa s) is
larger than previous estimates that yielded similar or larger
bending resistance (here similar to 25% of forces). This apparent
discrepancy occurs because slabs bend more gently than previously
thought, with an average radius of curvature of 390 km that
permits subduction Of Strong slabs. This gentle bending may
ultimately permit plate tectonics on Earth. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
