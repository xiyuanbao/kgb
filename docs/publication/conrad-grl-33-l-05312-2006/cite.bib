 abstract = {The shear tractions that mantle flow exerts on the base of
Earth's lithosphere contribute to plate-driving forces and
lithospheric stresses. We investigate the sensitivity of these
tractions to sub-lithospheric viscosity variations by comparing
shear tractions computed from a mantle flow model featuring
laterally-varying lithosphere and asthenosphere viscosity with
those from a model with layered viscosity. Lateral viscosity
variations generally do not change the direction of shear
tractions, but deeply penetrating continental roots increase
traction magnitudes by a factor of 2-5 compared to 100 km thick
lithosphere. A low-viscosity asthenosphere decreases traction
magnitudes by a smaller amount, and is important only if >100 km
thick. Increased plate-mantle coupling beneath thick continental
lithosphere may increase plate-driving forces, surface
deformation, and mantle-derived lithospheric stresses in these
regions. By contrast, a low-viscosity asthenosphere does not
decouple the lithosphere from mantle flow, highlighting the
geological importance of mantle tractions on the lithosphere.},
