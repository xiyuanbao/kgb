 abstract = {We use a new method to construct an upper mantle model
based on self-consistent computation of phase equilibria and
physical properties. Computation of the isotropic elastic wave
velocities of a pyrolytic bulk composition in thermodynamic
equilibrium shows a distinct low-velocity zone with a minimum
velocity V-S = 4.47 km s(-1) along the 100 Ma geotherm. In the
vicinity of the low-velocity zone the velocity of this null
hypothesis is approximated along oceanic geotherms by V-S = 4.77 +
0.0380(P, z/29.80) - 0.000378(T - 300), with pressure P in GPa,
depth z in km, temperature T in K, and velocity V-S in km s(-1).
The null hypothesis predicts a minimum V-S 0.1-0.2 km s(-1) higher
than that in seismological models of 100 Ma Pacific. We find that
dispersion, estimated solely on the basis of seismological
attenuation models, can account for this residual velocity
deficit. Except in the immediate vicinity of the ridge (t < 5 Ma),
a solid-state low-velocity zone provides a satisfactory
quantitative explanation of seismic observations. We do not find a
satisfactory explanation for the magnitude of the Gutenberg
discontinuity or for the high shear wave velocity gradient zone.},
