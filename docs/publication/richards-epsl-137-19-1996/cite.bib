 abstract = {Geodynamic models explain present-day plate motions in
terms of mantle buoyancy forces arising from subducted lithosphere
and lithospheric thickening, or from velocity anomalies mapped by
seismic tomography. However, such models do not account for sudden
plate tectonic reorganizations, such as the dramatic change in
Pacific plate motion implied by the sharp bend in the
Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain about 43 million years ago.
Candidate mechanisms for the Hawaiian-Emperor bend, such as
subduction initiation, ridge subduction, or the possibly
time-coincident collision between India and Asia, remain weakly
formulated and largely untested. We test the India-Asia collision
hypothesis using a model for Cenozoic plate motions driven mainly
by buoyancy forces introduced at paleo-subduction zones, and we
show that Pacific plate motion is virtually unaffected by the
development of compressional stresses along the India-Asia margin.
Geologic evidence suggests subduction initiation at about 43-48 Ma
along a transform boundary on the western Pacific plate margin,
but this mechanism is difficult to test. We speculate that
transform boundaries may guide plate motions for long periods of
time, and that rapid plate motion changes may result from the
creation or destruction of major transform faults. Speculations
aside, our results show that the character of global plate motion
changes is not adequately explained by current geodynamic models.},
