 abstract = {Using a self-consistent computation of phase equilibria and
physical properties, we determine isobaric velocity-temperature
and velocity-density scalings as a function of depth, focusing on
the upper 800 km. The scalings contain an isomorphic part due to
the influence of temperature on the physical properties of
individual phases, and a metamorphic part due to variation of
phase abundances and compositions with temperature. We show that
the contribution from phase transformations is comparable in
magnitude to that of temperature alone, and has important
consequences for mantle structure. Both scalings are highly
non-linear functions of temperature and depth even in the elastic
limit due to the influence of phase transitions: near sharp phase
transitions seismic velocities become much more sensitive to
temperature. We expect the magnitude of lateral variations in
seismic velocity to vary rapidly with depth. This result has
important implications for the interpretation of smoothed
tomographic models, particularly in the upper 1000 km, and
possibly the bottom few hundred kin, where phase transformations
have a large influence on the structure. It will be important to
include the metamorphic contribution of the scalings in
geodynamical studies relating seismic structure to thermal
structure or the gravity field. We find that the combined phase
buoyancy of transitions near 520 km depth is equal in magnitude to
that of the olivine to wadsleyite transition and should be
included in future dynamical studies. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All
